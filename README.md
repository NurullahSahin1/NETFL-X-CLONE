<h1>NETFLIX APP</h1>

<p>
    This project was created with the react vite js coding system and the Redux thunk method was used in the project. This project was inspired by the Netflix video watching application.
1- A randomly selected video from popular videos and its details are shown on the project homepage.
2- At the bottom of the page, there are movie posters for each category and they are moved sideways with the help of a slider.
3- Detailed information about each movie you click on can be found on the detail page.
4- The trailers of each movie can be accessed on the video detail page.
5- My project has a responsive design and is very functional.
